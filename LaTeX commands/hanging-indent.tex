% Note that this adds extra indentation to the generated reference section.
% To reset the reference section indentation, \setlength{\leftskip}{0em} must be added to the end of the document.

\setlength{\leftskip}{1.5em}	% Sets left-alignment point, effectively indenting all lines
\setlength{\parindent}{-1.5em}	% Offsets first line of paragraph back to normal alignment, effectively unindenting those lines
\usepackage{indentfirst}		% Applies indentation rules to first paragraph (LaTeX by default does not indent first paragraphs of sections)
